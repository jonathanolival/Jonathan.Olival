Welcome to my personal webpage.

Postdoctoral Researcher and Scientific Coordinator with an MSc in Molecular Biotechnology and a PhD in Human Genetics. Specialized in molecular laboratory techniques and genomic data analysis. Ultimately, I have been focused on genomic variant curation and interpretation in line with the latest ACMG/AMP guidelines. My work experience spans variant curation in a pilot project for newborn screening, collaboration with the NIH-funded resource ClinGen, and performing genomic data analysis and functional laboratory studies to identify candidate variants associated with, or potentially linked to, neurodevelopmental disorders and rare genetic diseases.
